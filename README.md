README.md for Text Adventure

### What is Text Adventure ###
Text Adventure is a very short text based game built in Unity 5 and C# while I was doing a MOOC on Unity Development.  
It was designed as a birthday special for a friend.  
Names and other identifying characteristics have been removed from Text Adventure.  

### How to run Text Adventure ###
You will need Unity to import the project and build it for your preferred device.  

### NOTE ###
I will be including links to PC/MAC/Android builds soon.
